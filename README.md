Developing predictive model using classification techniques to predict if the individual is diabetic or not.


Technical Scope: Python, Scikit-Learn packages, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost
•	Preprocessed 64 variables and 2500 instances of raw data to develop diverse classification models.
•	Built different classification models using SVM, Decision Tree, Random forest, AdaBoost (using Scikit-learn library).
•	Accumulated the "Best Classifier" selection, generated the lowest balance error, and produced a development model with 81.79% accuracy.
